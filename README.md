## Development server
Run `nx serve sukiapi` for expressjs based api, listening to port 3000 at http://localhost:3000/api. It also doubles down as full stack app, if the UI is bundled / build already.

Run `nx serve sukiui` for a UI dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
